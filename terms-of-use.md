# Terms of Use

Updated April 27, 2020

Universal Kash International (“UKI”, “uKASH”, “we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”) operates various cryptocurrencies, including uKASH and others, various blockchains, websites, blogs, forums, various mobile applications and platforms, including https://ukash.io, all subdomains of https://ukash.io, and others (all operations collectively referred to herein as the “Services”). These terms of use (“Terms of Use”) describe the terms and conditions applicable to your use of any and all Services operated by us that include a link to these Terms of Use. If there is a link to these Terms of Use on any website, mobile application or online service you are visiting, these Terms of Use apply. We may also offer mobile applications and websites that have their own terms of use. Please refer to the terms of use associated with the website or mobile application you are using for the governing terms of use. An Account is any and all access to the Services. End users of the Services are collectively referred to herein as “you”, “your”, and “Members”. Your access to and use of the Services is subject to all applicable laws and regulations and to these Terms of Use. By accessing, browsing, commenting, or purchasing services or goods on the Services, you agree to be bound, without limitation or qualification, to these Terms of Use, which form a legally binding contract. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use the Services.


## Software in the Services

To the extent that uKASH provides you with mobile applications or other software as part of the Services, we grant you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the software, but solely to the extent necessary for you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services in the manner permitted by these Terms of Use. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any software included as part of the Services. All right, title and interest in such software not expressly granted to you in this paragraph are reserved by uKASH and its licensors. However, to the extent we license one of our mobile applications or other software applications to you pursuant to a separate end user license agreement, the terms of that end user license agreement shall govern over any inconsistent provisions in this paragraph. Some software used in the Services may be offered under an open source license, and in such case, there may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of the terms of this paragraph.


## Information, News, and Press Releases

The Services may contain information, news, and/or press releases about us or others, including cross-references to others’ products or services. We disclaim any duty or obligation to update any such information, news, or press releases, and your reliance on information contained in these materials is at your own risk. Moreover, any opinions, advice, statements, comments, services, offers or other information expressed or made available by third parties, including users or others, are those of the respective author(s) and do not necessarily state or reflect the views, findings, or opinions of uKASH. Any description or reference to non-uKASH products, services or programs is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an endorsement or a recommendation of such products, services or programs by uKASH.


## Third-Party Sites and Linking

As a convenience to users, the Services may contain links to websites operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”). Third-Party Sites are not under the control of uKASH, and, as such, access to and use of such Third-Party Sites is at your own risk and subject to corresponding third-party, non-uKASH terms of use and privacy policies. We are not responsible for, do not endorse, and hereby disclaim any and all content, advice, or services found, learned, available, or provided on such Third-Party Sites. We reserve the right to terminate a link to a Third-Party Site at any time. The fact that we provide a link to a Third-Party Site does not necessarily mean that we endorse, authorize or sponsor that Third-Party Site, or that we are affiliated with the Third-Party Site. Unless otherwise set forth in a written agreement between you and uKASH, you must adhere to uKASH’s linking policy as follows: (a) the appearance, position and other attributes of the link may not be such as to damage or dilute the goodwill associated with uKASH’s name or any uKASH trademark or service mark; (b) the appearance, position, and other attributes of the link may not create the false appearance that your organization or entity is sponsored by, affiliated with, or associated with uKASH, and (iii) when selected by a user, the link must display the Services on full-screen and not within a “frame” on the linking site.

The Services and all Materials therein are protected by international copyright laws.

In exercising any permitted use of the Materials, you agree to leave all copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices intact.

## No Guarantee of Value

We make no guarantee of any value related to the Services. Your access to and use of the Services is an acknowledgment by you that the value of any cryptocurrency, such as uKASH, can go up, can go down, and/or may have no value at all. We make no guarantee that the Services, including any cryptocurrency (such as uKASH), will have any value at any given time.


## No Warranties

The Services and the materials (including all information, content (including user content), products, and services available on or through the Services) are provided to you on an “as is,” “as available” basis without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, data accuracy, and quiet enjoyment. uKASH makes no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of any materials available on or through the Services. No oral or written information or advice given by uKASH shall create a warranty of any kind. You are responsible for verifying any and all of the materials before relying on them. uKASH makes no representations or warranties that use of the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, completely secure, or free from viruses.


## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold uKASH and its parent, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, partners, members and employees harmless from any claim, action, demand, loss, or damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services, your use or submission of any content, your violation of the Terms of Use, or your violation of any law or rights of a third party. uKASH reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate fully with uKASH in asserting any available defenses.


## Limitation of Liability

The use of the Services and the materials is at your sole risk. uKASH specifically disclaims all liability, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or relating to your access to or use of the Services and the materials, even if uKASH has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall uKASH’s aggregate liability to you for all damages, losses and causes of action (whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, negligence or otherwise), exceed $100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law. In such cases, uKASH’s liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


## Disclosures

We may preserve and disclose content submitted by you if expressly authorized by you or if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms of Use; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of uKASH, users of Services, or the public.


## Compliance with Laws

Information available through the Services is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any military personnel or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation. uKASH makes no representation that the information available through the Services is appropriate or available for use in those locations, and access to the Services from any such locations where the content of the Services offered herein may be illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Services from other non-compliance locations do so on their own initiative and risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.


## Export Control

You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of the website or our services: (a) into any United Nation embargoed countries; or (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United Nation, or Interpol. By using the website and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also will not use the website or our services for any purpose prohibited by the United Nation, Interpol or any other law.


## Force Majeure

Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.


## Modifications

You should review these Terms of Use regularly as they may change. We reserve the right to update the Terms of Use from time to time by posting a new Terms of Use in the Services (e.g., posting on the website or in the settings tab of our mobile applications) and the “date of last revision” at the top of this page will be revised. You should consult the Terms of Use regularly for any changes, and your continued use of the Services after such changes have been posted constitutes acceptance of those changes. In addition, for material changes to these Terms of Use, as determined in our sole discretion, we will include a notice on the Services that directs users to a copy of the latest Terms of Use for review and/or send a communication to users notifying them of changes. If the modified Terms of Use are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services. uKASH’s failure to exercise any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use are provided in the English language and all communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to these Terms of Use will be in the English language. If you have any questions about the Services or these Terms of Use, please email us: dpo (at) ukash.io.
